I have made the data in JSON format. Basically, it is a huge list and each element is a dictionary for one patient including:

cancer: cancer type for this patient
OS: overall survival in days
EVENT: the status of this patient when the overall survival was measured
age: the age of this patient in years
BCR: a list of B cell CDR3 sequences and their constant genes (NA means missing information)
